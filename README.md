# CS3860 - Lab 5: 

Part one -  Implementing chunkIt and firstLoc in Haskell, C++, and Smalltalk

This repository contains my solutions for Lab 5 in the CS3860 course, where I implemented two functions in Haskell, C++, and Smalltalk:
- `chunkIt`: Splits a list into chunks of a given size.
- `firstLoc`: Finds the first occurrence of a target in a list.

---

##  How to Run the Files

```bash

### **Haskell (`partone.hs`):**

runhaskell partone.hs


###  **C++ (`partone.cpp`):**

g++ partone.cpp -o chunkIt && ./chunkIt



###  **Smalltalk (`partone.st`):**

gst partone.st

```


## Part Two 

# Hill Cipher in Haskell

This project is a Haskell implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption. I added debug messages to help me see matrixes and how they are multipliying. 

## Files
- `hill_cipher.hs`: Contains all functions for encryption, decryption, and user interaction.

## Requirements
- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)

##  How to Run the Files
```bash

Compile : ghc hill_cipher.hs -o hill_cipher

And then ----- :       /hill_cipher

```
